OpenTUI is a TypeScript library for building terminal user interfaces (TUIs). It is currently in
development and is not ready for production use. It will be the foundational TUI framework for both
[opencode](https://opencode.ai) and [terminaldotshop](https://terminal.shop).

Quick start with [bun](https://bun.sh) and [create-tui](https://github.com/msmps/create-tui):

```bash
bun create tui
```

This monorepo contains the following packages:

- [`@vybestack/opentui-core`](packages/core) - The core library works completely standalone, providing an imperative API and all the primitives.
- [`@vybestack/opentui-react`](packages/react) - The React reconciler for OpenTUI.

## Install

NOTE: You must have [Zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) installed on your system to build the packages.
